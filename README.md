# Dashboarding-SQL-Tableau

**
Objective

Your dashboard should revolve around these 4 main topics: sales, finance, logistics, and human resources.
Here are the indicators that should be present in your dashboard. Visualizations would also be appreciated. And you are invited to practice your advisory role, by proposing additional KPIs and charts.

Sales: The number of products sold by category and by month, with comparison and rate of change compared to the same month of the previous year.

Finances: 
The turnover of the orders of the last two months by country. 
Orders that have not yet been paid.

Logistics: The stock of the 5 most ordered products.

Human Resources: Each month, the 2 sellers with the highest turnover.

Nota bene: sometimes business indicators are not technically achievable. It is up to you to explain it, and to bring your own ideas to answer the business needs.
